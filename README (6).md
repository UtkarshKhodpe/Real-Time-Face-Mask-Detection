# Real_Time_Face_Mask_Detection
A real-time face mask detection system uses CNNs and OpenCV to determine if individuals in video streams are wearing masks. It involves training a CNN with images of masked and unmasked faces, then integrating this model with OpenCV for face detection and mask status classification in video feeds.
